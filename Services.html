If you come to visit you will hear contemporary preaching and be singing a mixture of old and new hymns from CH4. We use multimedia well and appropriately (less is more!) and have All-Age worship services spread throughout the year as well as the occasional evening service at Christmas and Eastertime. </p><p> We are developing a worship group to augment the traditional accompaniment of organ and piano. The choir and men’s voices choir are also regularly involved in worship and lay people share in the readings and prayers in the service. </p><p>Anyone and everyone is welcome to join us in worship each Sunday.</p>

At Belhelvie we celebrate the gift of children in two complementary ways. For those who see themselves and their children bring around the church in the longer term, and would consider themselves people of faith, baptism may well be the way to go. Over three preparatory meetings, the minister will unpack with you your hopes for your child, and the role that faith has in our lives. </p><p>For those who simply want to celebrate the baby’s arrival with family and friends in a church context, a service of thanksgiving for the birth of the child is the way to go. </p><p>You can find out more about these services HERE (link to material somehow?), or contact <a href="pmckeown1@btconnect.com?Sunday%20Worship"> Rev Paul McKeown</a> (Tel: 01358 742227) </p>
